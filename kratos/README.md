# Kratos dev server

Dev setup. Keep this up to date with the prod Kratos setup.

## Installation

You need to install `docker` and `docker-compose`.

```
sudo dnf install docker docker-compose
```
or whatever. For windows just use WSL or something.

## Running

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Then Kratos should be running on localhost.
